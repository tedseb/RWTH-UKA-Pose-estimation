This file contains code that deals with the  manual extraction of low-level features from skelletons.
At the time of writing, such features are explicitly angles. Other features might follow in the future.

TODO: Use msgpack at Shawans end do extract features there already? https://pypi.org/project/msgpack-numpy/
